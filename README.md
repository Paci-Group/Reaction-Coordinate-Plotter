# Plotting Reaction Coordinate Diagrams

Here is a script for plotting reaction coordinate diagrams. All data input and customization of the look of the graphs is done below the line if __name__ == "__main__", where I added examples that plot a delta-delta E bar plot, a regular delta E rxn coord diagram, and a rxn coord diagram with delta-delta E inset.
